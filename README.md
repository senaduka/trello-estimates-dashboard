# Trello estimates dashboard

Small Javascript application to sum the estimates entered in Trello.
Estimates are written somwhere inside Description field in the form of:
`Estimate: X` where X can be any whole number.

 Estimates are summed by label and by list and total number of hours is colorfully written in front of the label  list name.
 `?` instead of number of hours marks those labels that don't have any cards with estimates entered.
 

Code as taken from:
